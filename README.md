# Ideas-Possibilities
A list of projects that have potential or that Interest me


In this Repository I want to upload and edit projects that I've either started and left behind or have a real keen interest in continuing

Most of my inspiration for the projects that I commit to come from me playing around with a lot of different ideas and material

The ones I feel will benefit my growth are the ones I usually decide to work on. Whereas I leave the rest of the ideas in the dust.
So the purpose of this repository is to keep inventory of all different projects I've either started or have a strong interest in so that in the future, when I'm looking a new personal project, I will have a list waiting for me right here.

Each branch will present a different tool or inspiration that I can easily refer to
