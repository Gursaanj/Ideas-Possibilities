# Ideas-Possibilities


In this branch I put up all of my pixel art that I've made when I was inspired for certain project. Some are for certain small things like my Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) character or to create emojis and GIFs for my Club (AMS Game Development Association). Some are for bigger things like actual NPCs for the small games I make (or plan to make).
